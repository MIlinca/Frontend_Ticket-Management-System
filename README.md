# Frontend_Ticket-Management-System
This frontend is the graphical interface that users see and interact with when accessing the application on a laptop or computer. The development of this part aimed to provide a quality user experience that allows users to navigate through events, perform searches, filter results, view event details and manage orders. To achieve these goals, the frontend code uses JavaScript to make requests to a backend server and dynamically update the content of web pages.
